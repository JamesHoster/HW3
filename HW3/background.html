    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a confident, intuitive, smart, and caring individual. I am 21 years of age, although am commonly described as "an old soul" by most. Born in a town about a half an hour from Chicago, my childhood was spent building legos and playing kick the can(amonst other games) with friends in the couldesac. As I grew up my interests still remained creative. I would spend a lot of playing the drums and piano, skating, and playing video games. As I grew I still kept my interest in music and technology, and have built a few of my own computers. </p>
