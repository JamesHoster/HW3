                <p>You tell me this town ain't got no heart (well, well, well, you can never tell). The sunny side of the street is dark (well, well, well, you can never tell). Maybe that's cause it's midnight, in the dark of the moon besides. Maybe the dark is from your eyes (maybe the dark is from your eyes). Maybe the dark is from your eyes (maybe the dark is from your eyes). Maybe the dark is from your eyes (maybe the dark is from your eyes). You know you got such dark eyes!. Nothin' shakin' on shakedown street, used to be the heart of town. Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart, you just gotta poke around. You think you've seen this town clear through (well, well, well, you can never tell). Nothin' here that could int'rest you (well, well, well, you can never tell). It's not because you missed out on the thing that we had to start. Maybe you had too much too fast (maybe you had too much too fast). Maybe you had too much too fast (maybe you had too much too fast). Maybe you had too much too fast (maybe you had too much too fast). Or just over played your part. Nothin' shakin' on shakedown street, used to be the heart of town. Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart, you just gotta poke around. Since I'm passing your way today (well, well, well, you can never tell). I just stopped in 'cause I want to say (well, well, well, you can never tell). I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud. Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart (don't tell me this town ain't got no heart). Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart (don't tell me this town ain't got no heart). Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart (don't tell me this town ain't got no heart). When I can hear it beat out loud! Nothin' shakin' on shakedown street, used to be the heart of town. Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart, you just gotta poke around. Songwriters: Jerome J. Garcia / Robert C. Hunter</p>

            <h2>Shake and Bake</h2>
            <p>If you aint 1st your last. Long distance runner, what you standin' there for? Get up, get out, get out of the door Your playin' cold music on the barroom floor. Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core. There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town. Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down. Fire! fire on the mountain! Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat. It takes all you got just to stay on the beat. You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat. But you're here alone, there's no one to compete. If mercy's a business, i wish it for you. More than just ashes when your dreams come true. Fire! fire on the mountain! Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for? Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door. The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor. You gave all you had. why you want to give more?The more that you give, the more it will take. To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake. Fire! fire on the mountain! Songwriters: Mickey Hart / Robert Hunter</p>
