    <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I am fascinated with what I would call ground-floor travel. To go to a place and experience it as fully and richly as possible, sleeping outside anytime possible, walking everywhere possible or using public transportaion, spend time with locals and soak up the culture or just try to break through a language barrier. Another word one could call it, Backpacking. It's a dream of mine to backpack across all of our beautiful continents. I spent two and a half years backpacking around places in the United States, parts of Illinios, New Jersey, and Colorado. Although I haven't really backpacked them, I am blessed to have been able to spend time in all of our 50 states. I have also been to Shanghia and Beijing,China, however those times I was put up in a Marriot and had cabs most places. </p>
        <p>When I am not travelling I can usually be found hearing some live music. My favorite band would be the Grateful Dead hands down, however I love most music. Whether its rock, funk, folk, bluegrass, or jazz, I love it. Not a fan of country music however. </p>
